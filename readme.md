***Calorie Manager Project***

### Problem Statement
Tracking calories could be a complicated task, especially if the food is cooked at home.
After a few years of experience with tracking calories, I realize that it would be beneficial to 
have my own database with foods and recipes. This application would assist in storing and
retrieving calculated  data, which would make it a perfect app for the tablet in the kitchen.
