***Emoji-Rated News Project***

### Problem Statement
It has come to pass that even though there is joy attached to the process of reading the news,
 there also could be great sorrow accompanying such an activity. 
 Therefore, my soul inclines me to write a web application that would release me from such sorrows. 
 Additionally, such service would allow ease of access to the news that are sorted/rated by emojis.
 The hope is by seeing a certain emoji next to a news article one would have a base understanding of the article tone,
 content, etc. and therefore could make a judgement on whether to read it or not.
